Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, 
such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. 
In a classical computer, data is stored as bits, which can have one of two values:
 0 or 1. In a quantum computer, data is stored as quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist 
 in a state of superposition. This means that a qubit can represent a 0 and a 1 simultaneously. 
 Additionally, multiple qubits can become entangled, meaning that the state of one qubit can be 
 dependent on the state of the other qubits, even if they are separated by large distances. Because 
 of these properties, quantum computers can perform certain types of calculations much faster than 
 classical computers.

This is a very high level and simplified explanation, quantum computing has much more 
deeper and complex concepts like Schrodinger equation, wave functions, Unitary Matrices, etc. 
But in a nutshell, it is a method of computation that makes use of properties of quantum mechanics 
which allows for far more powerful ways of computation then classical computers.
